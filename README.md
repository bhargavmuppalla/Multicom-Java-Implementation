# Multicom-Java-Implementation
Our Implementation is done in Java file. 
The name of main file is App_v2.java. <br>
The dataset files are available in data folder. For each data set there will be 2 file, file 1 has edge list. File 2 is ground truth communities for the graph. <br>
Execute the program in virtual studio code or any other editor. Before executing few dependencies need to be added to the project, which are provided in dependency folder. These are related to DB Clustering algorithm, which we have not implemented and not implemented in main paper. So, making use of existing library functions. Add these dependencies in referenced library section incase of visual studio.<br><br>
For generating test results, in the main function of java file, separate functions are created for each test results. Functions named as Test1, Test2â€¦ so on.
